Logitech PowerShell Controller with Battery for iPhone 5/5S and iPod Touch 5th Generation - Black (Certified Refurbished) Whether in the air, on the road, or between classes, PowerShell opens a new world of mobile gaming with powerful console-style controls. Designed specifically for the iPod 5 and 5s and also for the iPod Touch 5th Generation - this is the game controller you've always wanted. Both groundbreaking new games and timeless classics can take advantage of iOS 7 and PowerShell's analog console-style controls. With iOS 7 controller-compatible games, there's no extra software to install. Just download a favorite and go. Use powerful, precise console-style analog controls to dominate your favorite iOS games, and your opponents, more easily than using on-screen controls. Plus, the analog d-pad, shoulder triggers and button cluster move your hands away from the screen for the clearest view of the action. Gaming isn't the only thing you do when you're on the go. PowerShell adds great gaming features without stopping you from snapping pictures, making calls, or listening to music. And volume up/down buttons, ring/silent switch, and power/sleep button all remain fully accessible. Stay plugged-in for great game sound, or for making a call. PowerShell includes a 3.5mm headphone adapter with an angled design to keeps cords safely away from the action. Intense gaming can strain your device's battery. PowerShell backs you up with a 1500 mAh battery, increasing the available power capacity of the iPhone 5, iPhone 5s or 5th generation iPod touch. When the external battery indicator shows power is low, use the included micro-USB cable to top up both your device and PowerShell. The lightweight, slim PowerShell goes with you anywhere. The streamlined shape means PowerShell fits easily into your pocket, bag, or backpack. Its comfortable curves and subtly textured, soft rubber surface offer a form-fitted comfortable grip for hours of gaming.
