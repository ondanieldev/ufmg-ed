AURALiC VEGA Digital Audio Processor Megahertz Upsampling Using latest ground breaking algorithm, MegahertzUpsampling technology process and up-sampling all incoming PCM signal to about 1.5MHz in 32bit depth. These not only improve the precision of DAC, but also create a new Nyquist frequency for all PCM signal which farther away from the top end of audio frequency. As a result, our engineers are able to design a brand new analog circuit structure with more bandwidth and faster slew rate. Comparing to previous design, the new structure is more transparent to audio signal with lower distortion and less noise, it also lets red book CDs sound more rich and smooth. AURALiC ORFEO Class-A Output Module In order to drive various loads, matching different power amplifiers, VEGA is powered with AURALiC's patentedORFEO Class-A module which is inspired by Neve8078 analog consoles circuit design as the output stage. The principle of this module is to use a mass of small signal components with best linear characteristic. By packing them though a thermal balance procedure and bias the transistors into Class-A, ORFEO achieves impressive performance with open loop distortion less than 0.001%. The ORFEO module used in VEGA has been selected and tweaked for lower noise while maintains its driving capability for600ohm load without any distortion raise.
