Griffin Coral Multi Positional TurnFolio for Small to Medium-sized Tablets - Rotating case and a custom fit for your 7-8" tablet The TurnFolio cover opens and closes like a book and folds into an adjustable viewing stand. A silicone GripGrid inside the cover lets you fine-tune the viewing angle so that it's just right for you. Inside the cover, a protective frame grips your tablet with special elastic clips that grip its edges, leaving the entire surface of your touchscreen accessible to your fingers. The frame rotates a full 360 degrees, for viewing in landscape or portrait or any angle in between. And the inside is fully lined with soft, nonscratch Microliner fabric. When you want to work one-handed, the TurnFolio frame snaps out of the covers to stay with your tablet. Just snap it back in to use it as a viewing stand or fold it up and go.
