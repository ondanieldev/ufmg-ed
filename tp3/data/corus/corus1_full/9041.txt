HP ZBook 17 J2M31UT#ABA 17.3" LCD Compatible Display Screen New Sold product is 40Pin bottom right thin frame LCD. It is not regular 30 Pin LCD. In past orders customers were getting confused about pin configuration and they think they are buying standard 30 Pin LCD. So again pay attention to pin configurations. This is 40 pin EDP Connection LCD. This is not standard 30 Pin LCD and if you trying to replace this one with standard 30 Pin LCD it will not work. Please match your original screen's BACKLIGHT TYPE, SIZE, and RESOLUTION before you purchase this item, because some laptop models come with more than one type of screens.
