Alphacool NexXxos Monsta Radiator 560, 140mm x 4, Quad Fan Every user of a water cooling system needs a radiator and everyone has different requirements towards the heat exchanger. Of course the customer always demands the best in its class. The Alphacool NexXxos radiators have come to compete with and to beat the best in their class and to be the best radiator in all sizes. No more endless choices without a clear class leader, the Alphacool NexXxos is the one tool for all your needs! Alphacool has been the company to introduce new developments and improvements in the radiator and water cooling sector generally many times over the last years. Following this tradition, the new NexXxos radiators are the first to truly deserve the Full copper attribute. All main parts, not only the fins and channels, but the chambers are also made from copper. This brings an improvement in performance where other radiators are left without a chance. The material already gives an advantage over the competition and the inner structure is up to par with the competition. Separated chambers give the coolant a clear direction, allowing high flow rates which improve the performance of the whole cooling loop. Flat chambers on the heat exchanger increase mounting flexibility thanks to the reduced overall length. Versatile and easy mounting is one of the main points, on which the research and development department at Alphacool focused. The chamber offers three possibilities for fitting installation on both inlet and outlet (not on the NexXos ST30). Less angled fittings are needed, improving flow rates and offering more mounting possibilities. Hence the radiator can even be installed in tight enclosures, where otherwise internal installation is not a possibility. A 1/4" screw plug allows easy de-aeration of the radiator (on all UT60 and NexXxos Monsta) and hassle-free vertical installation of the heat exchanger.
