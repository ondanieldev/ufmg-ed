Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga - Core i5-6200U, 256GB SSD, 14in Full HD Touch Display, 8GB RAM, Windows 10 Pro Thin and light 14" 2-in-1 convertible, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga supports four flexible usage modes for when you want to work, present, create, and connect. The full-sized, backlit keyboard is spill-resistant and the keys retract automatically when not being used as a laptop, so they are not exposed when the keyboard is face-down on a desk or table. Plus, the X1 Yoga is tested against military specifications and made to endure extremes. Yet for all its durability, it weighs just 2.8 lbs / 1.27 kg. Like the rest of the X1 family, this convertible Ultrabook is thin, light, and tough. The X1 Yoga features a 14" Full HD touch screen display. The X1 Yoga includes a dockable stylus pen that recharges when connected-just 15 seconds of charging gives up to 100 minutes of use. And because it docks into the laptop, you can keep it handy for when you need it for drawing, annotating documents, or making notes. With Lenovo's exclusive WRITEit technology, you can enter handwriting into any input field across hundreds of apps, and it automatically suggests and corrects your writing.
