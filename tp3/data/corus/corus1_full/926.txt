ByteRunner USB to Serial Adapter Need a serial port? This high quality and inexpensive USB to serial adapter will provide a high-speed serial port for your serial application. Just connect it to the USB connection on your computer, and the adapter will automatically map in as a serial port through plug & play detection. (A driver may need to be loaded off the included CD-ROM disc, or you can download the latest drivers from the chipset maker Prolific.) There aren't any IRQ or COM port conflicts since no additional resources are required. Provides screw downs, and is 5 feet long, so you can go from the USB port directly to the 9-pin female serial connector on your device and screw it down for a secure connection. Compatible with Windows 98, 98SE, ME, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 7 and MAC OS8 & later.
