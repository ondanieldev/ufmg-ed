iGadgitz Premium Rotating Red PU Leather Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0" SM-T310 With Auto Sleep Wake + 360 Viewing Angle Stand + Screen Protector Our custom made 360 degree rotating PU Leather case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 inch is the perfect accessory for your tablet.  The main feature of the case is a 360 degree rotating stand that offers viewing positions in both portrait and landscape mode. The rotational tablet holder also detaches from the cover stand using a stud fastener. This allows users to interact with the tablet independently from the cover stand catering to everyday scenarios. A simple, versatile design. Tailored cut-outs are provided around all the tablet features including the all-important speakers for maximum sound output.  When not using the device, attach the case to the stud fastener and rotate 180 degrees. This will keep the volume and power buttons fully protected to prevent damage and ensure the tablet is stored in a power-safe mode.  Our mm design ensures tailored cut-outs around the tablet for comfortable interaction for users. A secure elastic strap keeps your tablet firmly in position, preventing drops and scratches. Our clever sleep/wake technology puts your tablet to sleep, and an elastic strap keeps the case secure when closed.  Supplied with stick-on screen protector. These unique features set our case apart from the competition. Give it a try...
