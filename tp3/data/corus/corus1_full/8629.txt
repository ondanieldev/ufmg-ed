DPA 4017B | Shotgun Microphone The DPA 4017B Shotgun Microphone is a professional, versatile microphone designed for demanding sound capturing in film, video, sound reinforcement and even music recording. The supercardioid, lobe-shaped polar pattern is coupled with excellent off-axis signal rejection for a focused pickup, enhanced range and minimal noise. The condenser capsule uses a high voltage pre-polarized back plate, endowing the shotgun with high output as well as wide dynamics, extremely low noise and distortion specifications.
