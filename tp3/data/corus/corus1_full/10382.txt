AntMiner C1 ~1008GH/s Bitcoin Miner with Water Cooling Kit Included This is a new item tested as working and comes with an upgraded cooling system the MCR-320 by Swiftech and Free Netgear Ethernet to Wifi adaptor. An all in one pump, radiator, and reservoir system which is far better than the standard cooling kit and allows for at least 20 to 30 degrees cooler than stock system. I can include barbs and hose clamps but tubing and cooling liquid will be needed as well.
