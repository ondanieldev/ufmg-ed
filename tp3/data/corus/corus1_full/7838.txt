ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) Coated PET Plastic - 100mm x 200mm ITO is a clear, conductive liquid/film and here we have it as a coating on a flexible plastic (PET) sheet. This is a very interesting and fun material, also used in scientific research and LCD/OLED manufacture! One side of the plastic is coated in ITO, you can use the flat of a blade or similar to scrape away some of the film to create 'traces'. It may also be possible to use a laser cutter to pattern it. We're looking forward to seeing what people do with this cool stuff! It's not possible to solder to this material, but you can use conductive inks, paints, copper tape (with conductive adhesive) and alligator clips to make contact.
