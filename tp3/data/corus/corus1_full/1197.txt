Skooba / RoadWired Skooba Superbungee Strap (Black w/Blue) The Skooba Superbungee Strap features what we call a "sport-tuned suspension system", consisting of a high-density, floating bungee/shock cord ring which acts as a shock absorber, minimizing carrying shock and perceived weight.  On the reverse (wearer) side of the contoured shoulder pad is a flexible grid of individual, air-filled cells to further enhance carrying comfort. The cells are covered in a friction laminate, to help keep even the heaviest bag from slipping.
