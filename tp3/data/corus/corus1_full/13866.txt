SunFounder Remote Control Robot Smart Car Kit V2.0 for Arduino Uno R3 Ultrasonic Line Follower Sensor IR Receiver Introduction This smart car robot kit is a great platform to get started with robots. What we provide are multiple parts, instructions and code needed, so you need to assemble them by yourself, with the help of the user guide. During the course you can thus enjoy the fun of making! Based on the manual in the kit package, you can make the car all by yourself and then create your own sketch to realize different movements of the car as you want. It supports remote control, line following, hand tracking and obstacle avoidance. For further exploration, a sensor shield is used so that there can be more I/Os from the SunFounder Uno, to which more parts can be connected.
