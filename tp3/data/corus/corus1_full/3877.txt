Jot Flip ink cartridge Call it clever styling or stylized functionality, the Jot Flip Stylus is one super sexy tool that every tablet or smartphone owner must have. Being a fan of sketching and taking notes on the go, the stylus offers me the convenience of drawing on a tablet and taking notes in a book. It features a precision disc that acts like your finger, except it lets you see exactly where your mark will be made on the tablet screen. Flip the barrel and a fine-tipped steel pen emerges from the other side. Truly, its one of the best digital stylus around!
