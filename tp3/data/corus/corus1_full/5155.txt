Viper hardcase 13, graphite Designed for 13-inch MacBooks, the Viper hardcase 13 is a compact, refreshingly stylish and durable case that offers two levels of protection: A slick, rugged water-resistant 1682 Denier ballistic nylon exterior provides superior protection from abrasive surfaces and the elements, while the nicely padded, non-scratch neoprene and nylon twill interior of this case snugly cradles your laptop and provides additional storage space for your accessories. This case's tough but lightweight, handle-less design allows you to easily slip it into your favorite booq laptop bag or backpack for added protection, and its premium construction is rounded out with a tough, reliable YKK zipper which tightly seals the case without coming in contact with the surface of your laptop.
