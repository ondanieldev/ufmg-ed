NA-SAVP1 chromax.Green The NA-SAVP1 chromax.green is a fan accessory set consisting of 16 green NA-AVP1 anti-vibration pads for up to 2 compatible 120/140mm fans (see compatibility info). Made from extra-soft silicone, the NA-AVP1 pads minimise the transmission of minute vibrations while maintaining full compatibility with standard fan screws and most other mounting systems. At the same time, the chromax.green edition is ideal for adding green accents to Noctuas industrialPPC fans in order to colour-coordinate them with individual build themes. Please note that the NA-AVP1 pads are not compatible with third-party fans.
