JacobsParts UH3-09 3-Port USB 3.0 Hub with Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter for Windows, Mac, and Linux Add USB 3.0 ports and a gigabit ethernet port to your computer. It is designed to achieve maximum throughput, whether it's connected to a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 device, a USB 2.0 device, or to a wired network. The sleek compact design makes it an excellent choice for use with both laptop and desktop computers. USB hubs are always driver free, they just work. For the network interface, no driver disk is required. On Linux and Mac OS 10.6+, just plug it in and the network interface shows right up. On Windows, if the drivers are not present, a virtual CD image will show up and auto-install the drivers. If you wish to manually install the drivers for any reason, they can be downloaded here.
