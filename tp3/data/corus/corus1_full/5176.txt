Star Trek Borg Cube Monitor Mate Imagine this awesome Borg Cube looming over your desk, threatening all with assimilation! It measures about 2-inches on each side, stands approximately 3-inches tall including its base, and adheres to your computer monitor with a non-damaging adhesive pad. The finely detailed mini bobble head presents a patchwork of tubes and conduits on all sides in black, silver, and green, and is made of resin. The base features the Star Trek: The Next Generation logo. Collect your own piece of the Collective! The Borg are the most fearsome foe faced by the heroes of Star Trek, from their first appearance in the second season of The Next Generation through numerous episodes of Voyager, Deep Space Nine, and Enterprise, to their starring role in Star Trek: First Contact. Their goal is to assimilate all intelligent life into the "hive" mind known as the Borg Collective. They travel throughout the galaxy in thousands of Borg Cubes and actually succeed in temporarily assimilating Captain Picard as a Borg named Locutus, while Captain Janeway rescues Seven of Nine from their clutches.
