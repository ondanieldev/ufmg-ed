Crumpler Casual Messenger Bag The Herbas (Gunmetal) Too big. Too bulky. Too busy. Too right. When you're a pared back, travel light, waif-o-thin lappie toting type, you need a bag that looks and feels the same way - like the uber minimalist Herbas. More thinline than slimline, this bare essentials over-the-shoulder satchel incorporates a sleeve for your 13-inch poota and/or A4 documents, a second compartment for cables and stuff, plus a secret stash johnny pocket - all secured by a large flap and industrial-size clasp. Available in both horizontal and vertical styles, the large Herbas features a super tough, water resistant 900D outer, fully adjustable strap, and like every Crumpler, is covered by our 'Til death do us part' lifetime warranty.
