HiLetgo 4pcs L298N Motor Driver Controller Board Module Stepper Motor DC Dual H-Bridge for Arduino Smart Car Power UNO MEGA R3 Mega2560 Specification: Chip: ST L298N dual H-bridge driver chip Logic voltage: 5V Logic current 0mA-36mA Storage Temperature: -20  to +135  Operating mode: H-bridge driver (dual) Drive voltage: 5V-35V Drive current: 2A (MAX single bridge) Maximum power: 25W Driver Board Size55mm*60mm*30mm Driver Board Weight:33g Dimensions: 43x43x27mm Note: .General Application: When your driver is 7V-12V, you can enable the on-board 5V logic supply. When using the on-board 5V power supply, the + 5V power supply in the interface does not input voltage, but it can draw 5V voltage for external use. .Unconventional application of high-voltage drive: When the driving voltage is higher than 12V, less than or equal to 24V, for example, to drive a motor with rated voltage of 18V, the jumper cap with 5V output enabled on-board voltage must be pulled out and then outside the 5V output port Connect 5V voltage to L298N internal logic voltage supply. Package Included: 4* L298N Motor Driver controller Board ModuleThere are two ways to turn the system back on:1. flip the power switch on the back of the computer and wait for the power supply cap to discharge as the relay will reset without power.2.after popping the hood and examining for faults, press the button on the relay.There is a red LED on this for power and a green LED to indicate the relay is activated, so you can be pretty sure what state this is in .Any time you are trying to hot wire an ATX power supply and you need a toggle function besides the switch in the back, just needs power from pin 9, the relay connected to pin 16 and then of course connections back to ground pin(s).
