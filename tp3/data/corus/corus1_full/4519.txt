iGadgitz Black 360Â° Rotating Detachable PU Leather Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 N8000 WiFi 3G Android Tablet + Screen Protector Our 360 degree rotating case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1" is the perfect accessory for your tablet. The main feature of the case is a 360 degree rotating stand that offers viewing positions in both portrait and landscape mode. The rotational tablet holder also detaches from the cover stand using a stud fastener. This allows users to interact with the tablet independently from the cover stand catering to everyday scenarios. A simple, versatile design. When not using the device, attach the case to the stud fastener and rotate 180 degrees. This will keep the volume, power and headphone ports fully protected to prevent damage and ensure the tablet is stored in a power-safe mode. This rotation will also free the charging port to allow you to charge your device. Our mm design ensures tailored cut-outs around the tablet for comfortable interaction for users. A secure elastic strap keeps your tablet firmly in position, preventing drops and scratches. Supplied with stick-on screen protector. These unique features set our case apart from the competition.
