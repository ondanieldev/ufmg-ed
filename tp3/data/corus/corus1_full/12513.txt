Sacred Geometry Vinyl Sticker - Chakana Sticker The title of this sticker is Chakana. You will receive the sticker in the first photo. The center circle of this sticker is die-cut, as to allow for illumination. Chakana (or Inca Cross) symbolizes for Inca mythology what is known in other mythologies as the World Tree, Tree of Life.. The stepped cross is made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square represents the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are Hana Pacha (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), Kay Pacha, (the world of our everyday existence) and Ucu or Urin Pacha (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels. It is also said to represent Cuzco, the center of the Incan empire, and the Southern Cross constellation. The original artwork on this sticker is inspired by a garden mushroom. The design reflects the balance and symmetry within nature and is influenced by mandalas, kaleidoscopes, and sacred geometry. Sacred geometry can be described as a belief system attributing to many of the fundamental forms of space and time. By studying the nature of these forms and their relationship to each other, one may seek to gain insight into the scientific, philosophical, psychological, aesthetic and mystical laws of the universe.
