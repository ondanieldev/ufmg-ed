Ju-Ju-Be MicraBe Tablet Carrier  - Earth Leather - Black/Hot Pink Since you're the smartest one at the office or on campus, you need to have the smartest bag too! The JuJuBe MicraBe isn't just pretty face, it's the most intelligent laptop/tablet/smartphone/portable workstation carrier around! Gusseted tech pocket holds your wireless mouse, cell phone, business cards, pens, SIM cards, thumb drives and lip gloss just to name a few.

BeCool Venting Technology (yes, it's for real) is a perforated foam and breathable lining that lets your laptop breathe when it goes in there hot. Corners are cushioned with an extra layer of shock absorbing foam. A unique zipper lip actually holds your computer in, even if you forget to zip it up.Ooops! In any case, MicraBe is super smart and in Earth Leather it really makes a statement. Earth Leather is animal free, beautiful faux leather that fools even the best trained eye. The bags also have antiqued all metal hardware for ultimate durability and AglON (nature's antimicrobial) lining to help fight germs.
