Griffin, Survivor CrossGrip for iPad mini, Protective Gaming Case with shoulder strap, Ergonomic, Rugged, Clear/Blue *Some early packaging may refer to this product as Survivor Play. It's made of tough silicone, shaped to fit a two-handed gaming grip, while providing extra padding where your iPad needs it most: at the corners. Underneath the silicone, there's a skeleton of stiff polycarbonate plastic that gives it shape and acts like a bulletproof vest for your iPad. Cutouts and raised button covers give you access to the ports, cameras and controls of your iPad. An adjustable shoulder strap clips directly into the polycarbonate skeleton at any of four connection points, to give you lots of handsfree carrying options. How well does Survivor perform?
