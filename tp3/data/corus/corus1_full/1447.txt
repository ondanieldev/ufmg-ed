NEC SpectraView II Color Calibration Kit (SVII-PRO-KIT) Designed for professionals with color-critical applications, SpectraViewII combines award-winning NEC display technology with a color-measurement sensor and sophisticated calibration software. The result is highly accurate, reliable, repeatable, feature-rich solution for display calibration and profiling. The SpectraViewII system uses a color sensor to take color measurements of the display screen during calibration. The software analyzes these measurements and sends color adjustment commands directly to the display monitor. This means that color adjustments are made in the monitor rather than in the video graphics adapter. With SpectraViewII, the video graphics adapter is not used at all to make any gamma or Tone Response Curve corrections to the display, so the fidelity of the system is maintained.
