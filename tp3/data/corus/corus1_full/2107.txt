Zyxel XOHM WIMAX WIRELESS MODEM MOD206M Zyxel XOHM Wimax WIRELESS MODEM  This modem operates exactly like your cable or DSL modem, without the need to plug anything into a hardwired line Simply plug the modem into a power source and then you have the option of either connecting it to your computer via ethernet OR hooking it up to any standard WiFi router and connecting that way. The built-in internal antenna is very powerful and can reportedly pull in a stronger signal than the ExpressCard. If you need to share the signal with multiple computers, this is definitely the device for you.  The size of the device is small enough to make it portable (6.5"W x 6.45"H x 4.65"D), but you will need a power source. This modem is best for people that are going to use the service mainly in one place, or, if they travel, know that they will have access to a power supply.
