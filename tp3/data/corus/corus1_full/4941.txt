Note	Due to the insufficient compressive capacity of the original package,the tablet screen is easy to be crushed during transport.So the tablet will be packaged in a new packaging.After careful consideration and testing,we believe the foam box is more resistant to rude handling.So we will use foam box instead of original package in order to keep the tablet PC safe.Moreover,our foam box will be improved all the time.  	 This product will be shipped with adapter plug for the country of the buyer.
