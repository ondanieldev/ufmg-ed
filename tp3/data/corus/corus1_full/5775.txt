Griffin Cabana Journal for iPad 2, 3, and (4th gen.), pink - Carry your iPad like a personal notebook in our Journal case. Journal for iPad is the perfect balance of protection, portability, and quick convenient access to your Multi-Touch display. It flips open for quick access to your touchscreen, and closes like a book for privacy and protection. Journal's edges are designed to grip your tablet securely, while allowing maximum access to edge connectors and controls. This folio protects your iPad while you're carrying it, but it doesn't stop working when you get where you're going. The cover quickly converts to an adjustable 3-position stand. Journal holds your iPad upright in two upright landscape positions for reading and viewing pictures. For drawing, tapping and typing, the stand slips down into a comfortably inclined position.
