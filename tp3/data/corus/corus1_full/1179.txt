Brother Max 3 Combi Bibs Because soft cotton tops are best for comfort and plastic ones are best for catching crumbs, the Brother Max 3 Combi Bibs combines both. Nobody likes a messy bag when out of the house, so the cotton top rolls up inside the crumb catcher, along with any cutlery used. And no one wants a messy baby, so these cotton bibs are plastic lined, meaning food and drink can't seep through the bibs. What's more the cotton tops are machine washable and tumble dryer friendly, making life that little bit easier.
