Akasa Anti-Vibration Fan mounts The rubber mounts isolate the case fan from the PC chassis thereby stopping vibration and resonance transmission. Structure born noise is prevented by the rubber cushions helping to provide a quiet PC system. Eliminating vibration additionally helps to reduce the stress on system components. Universal siliconized rubber pins enable quick and tool free mounting of all popular size case fans.
