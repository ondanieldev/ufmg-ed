D-Force Deluxe Dance + Pump USB Dance Pad The Deluxe Dance Pad is an improvement over our standard dance pad in 2 ways:   1. 1 super high density foam inserts which inflate the pad to a more arcade-like platform. This ensures that the pad remains firmly grounded. The result is greater comfort to the player, the ability to advance to higher levels, and ultimately the ability to achieve higher scores.   2. Raised, reinforced buttons act as a sensory aid, enabling the player to gauge his/her exact position on the dance pad at all times.   The D-Force Deluxe Dance Pad also features super-sensitive, no delay technology, and is constructed of smooth material which allows fluid transitions from step to step.
