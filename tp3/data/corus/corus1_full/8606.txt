10ft Controller USB Charging Cable for Xbox One (Green) by ienza Play and charge Xbox One Controller up to 10ft away from the power source! Great alternative to the short OEM cable. If you run out of power in the middle of a game you don't have to sit 2 feet from the screen now while the controller charges!
