Drake Men's MST Eqwader Pluss Full Zip Max-5 DW4330 (SM) Our patented Eqwader technology revolutionized waterfowl clothing and has been a core piece of the Drake Waterfowl brand since day one. Just like the Earth's equator is the dividing line between two distinct temperate zones, we noticed a similar dividing line on the body when you are wearing chest waders: cold, hostile conditions above the waders, and warm, humid conditions underneath the waders. Our unique combination of waterproof/breathable fabric on the sleeves and upper body matched with ultra-breathable fleece on the lower body introduced a whole new level of comfort and performance when wearing chest waders. The moisture-wicking fleece on the lower torso is 15 times more breathable than the upper waterproof material and works to prevent the build-up of perspiration and moisture vapor. These dual zones of protection keep you dry both inside and outside your waders. Available in both a Full Zip Jacket and a Quarter-Zip Pullover, and a wide range of camo patterns and solid colors, the Eqwader Plus is a staple product for waterfowl hunters everywhere.
