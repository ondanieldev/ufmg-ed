First, Swipe with the Cleaning Side to apply HNS Cleaning Solution and begin actively cleaning and cutting through and lifting grease, grime, dirt, and oils. Step 1 - Swipe Cleaning Side Directly on Surface to Lift Dirt and Grime. Step 2 - Swipe Polishing Side Directly on Surface for a Like-New Shine. HNS works that easily and that well. Clean your smartphones, tablets, touchscreens, car touchscreens, screen protectors, plus cases and covers and more. Germs can live up to a week in the grease, grime and oil that builds up when not properly cleaned, making your device's surface a germ breeding ground! HNS Cleaning Solution cuts through the build-up and lifts the dirt from the surface - allowing easy Cleaning and Polishing for that first-time shine. HNS Swipe-Clean is completely refillable with HNS Cleaning Solution for literally 1,000s of Cleans. Re-wrap the Microfiber Polishing Sheet when you're on the go; wash to work like new. HNS is easy to use and even easier to refill. After a big cleaning job it may make sense to clean your HNS Swipe-Clean even if its not empty. You'll refill what has been used and clean your HNS all at once. Just fill the Cleaning Side cap with HNS Cleaning Solution, place your HNS Swipe - Clean (Cleaning Side down) into the cap and allow to sit and soak up the Cleaning Solution (illustrated in the product photos).
