Your feedback is important!We at Gusti Leather are focused on satisfying our valued customers, rather than maximizing our sales figures. Only 0.3% of our customers have given us negative or neutral feedback stating the following reasons: 'minor flaws in the leather', 'minor inaccuracies in stitching' and 'distinctive leather scent'.Unfortunately, these small imperfections cannot be avoided with genuine leather. Therefore, even with the high standards we employ, we would like to specify before your purchase that some products may be subject to miniscule seam defects and could possibly contain minor flaws in the leather (delivered bag can be slightly different from the photo).As we at Gusti Leather use all of our leather responsibly when producing our bags, there may be cases where additional patches of leather are sewn on to our products. This adds to the charm of the product as well as to its uniqueness.
