Studio Oh! Leah Duncan Cord and Charger Zip Pouch, Sunrise (84706) We all have them: tablets, laptops, readers, phones, etc.; they're all must-haves these days. And naturally, each one requires its own unique cord and charger, which means you're toting multiple cords from meeting to meeting, home to office or school to home. Do you ever feel like the rhythm of your day is governed by the availability of electrical outlets? Studio Oh!'s fresh, new collection of Tech Accessories will not only help to keep all those cords neatly tucked away, but will do it fashionably. Take the Zip Pouch, for example. It measures a petite 6-1/4 x 4-1/2 x 1 inches (large enough cords, thumb drives, etc.), features the delightfully charming artwork of Leah Duncan and is beautifully handcrafted from heavyweight textured cotton, which provides added durability, strength and a pleasing organic feel. The pouch's clever mix of coordinating fabrics give it a playful personality, and the inside is colorfully lined with cheery lime-green 100% cotton. And, as a final nod to whimsy, the pouch's zipper is adorned with a pretty, pewter-look decorative pull delicately embossed with a sweet little birdie. Each of Studio Oh!'s three Tech Accessory collections includes a tablet carrier, tablet sleeve and 3 zipper pouch sizes to store anything from cosmetics to cords and chargers. From beautiful calendars loaded with super functional planning features and stationery and journals that move and inspire to home, kitchen and table decor accessories with plain-old-amazing designs, Studio Oh! invites you to explore their extraordinary products available on Amazon. About the artist: Leah Duncan began her career path as a graphic designer for an advertising agency and a screen-printing company. In 2008, she moved to Austin, Texas, where she applied her creative talents to fabric design. Her whimsically designed goods now appear in handmade and boutique markets internationally.
