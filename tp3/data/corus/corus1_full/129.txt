Toshiba Satellite 2405-S201 Laptop (1.6-GHz Pentium 4, 256 MB RAM, 30 GB hard drive) The 2405-S201 is a powerful computer, but not so powerful that you're forced to pay extra for state-of-the-art components. Driven by a fast 1.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with 256 MB of SDRAM (expandable to 512 MB), a fast front-side bus speed of 400 MHz, and a 16 MB TriStar 64C+ graphics chip, the unit will efficiently handle anything but the most technologically advanced 3-D rendering applications and games. Its large 40 GB hard drive offers plenty of storage space, and its combo DVD-ROM/CD-RW drive allows you to archive vast quantities of data, play and burn audio CDs, and enjoy the latest Hollywood blockbusters. Toshiba has even included an internal 3.5-inch floppy disk drive for older applications and smaller backup requirements.  Featuring a positional 3-D sound card, an integrated set of stereo speakers, and a generous 14.1-inch XGA TFT active-matrix display capable of 1,024 x 768 resolution and 16 million colors, the 2405-S201 looks and sounds as good as it runs. The unit is not particularly small at 12.8 by 11.2 by 1.7 inches and 7.54 pounds, nor is it so cumbersome that you won't want to take it with you across town or across the country.  Wherever you go, the 2405-S201 makes it easy to stay in touch. The system features a wealth of input and output options, including an integrated 56K modem for on-the-road Internet and e-mail access, a 10/100 Ethernet LAN for network connectivity and high-speed surfing, three USB ports for plug-and-play peripherals, a headphone and microphone jack, and a PC Card slot. The system's control center features an 85-key keyboard, convenient two-button touch pad, a scroll pad, and hot keys.
