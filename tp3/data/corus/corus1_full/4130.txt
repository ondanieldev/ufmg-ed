Commodore C64x Barebones System The new Commodore 64 Barebones features genuine Cherry brand key switches, which provide a feel much better than the original, with a lovely IBM classic mechanism and click sound. The keys are the exact same shape as the original and are color matched. No expense has been spared. This is the ultimate hackers keyboard on which to wield your key-fu. A multi format card reader/writer and a USB slot are provided on the right side of the unit. The classic power light is now the power button.
