LapWorks Soft Grip Kindle Fire HDX Handle Stand Some kindle grips can fatigue your hand because the strap is too rigid or rough in texture. And then there's the problem with where to lay the kindle down when you're done with it. And don't forget that your kindle can act as a video picture frame if you have a way to prop it up for viewing. Well now there's hope! The soft grip kindle fire hdx 8.9" handle stand solves all these problems. It has a two inch wide, very soft neoprene hand strap for comfort; push two buttons and the handle pops out to become a stand and now that your kindle has a ready-made stand, you can pose it as a video picture frame. Voila! Note that this makes a nice viewing angle, but for touch typing, please consider our other stands. The soft grip fits the kindle fire hdx 8.9" but does not fit any other kindle models. The neoprene handle is completely adjustable with velcro and can accommodate the largest of hands, left or right handed. Besides sliding your hand through the neoprene handle, the handle can also be gripped with a fist so as to adjust your hand position for variety of movement. The handle stand also has a low-profile 360 degrees swiveling mechanism that is no thicker than the case that surrounds your kindle. The high impact abs plastic case that protects the kindle has a rubberized finish on both sides that are soft to the touch and can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth and a little tlc. The case can be easily snapped onto the kindle and once attached it holds with a vengeance. But can also be easily removed as needed - start by snapping off one corner at a time.
