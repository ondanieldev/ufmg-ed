DFROBOT Romeo BLE - Arduino Robot Control Board with Bluetooth 4.0 INTRODUCTION   The Romeo BLE is a new member of Romeo Family. This robot controller inherits all functions of Romeo all-in-one controller, the Romeo BLE has integrated bluetooth 4.0, it is the first time to give a robot control board the power of easy set up. Thanks to the bluetooth 4.0, the Romeo BLE supports uploading sketch wireless which means you do not need to plug a cable to upload new code. Just need a USB Bluno Link adapter, the Romeo Ble is ready to be updated through the Air which is so convenient for robot application.   With Romeo BLE, all DFRobot's mobile platforms and robots can now be played with iOS devices by APP "GoBle". Also, the Romeo BLE supports Visual Programming APP (WhenDo).
