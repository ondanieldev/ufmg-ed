Matrox Triplehead2Go Triple Analog Graphics Experience Surround Graphics Building on the award-winning DualHead2Go technology, Matrox is proud to present TripleHead2Go, a palm-sized box that uniquely allows you to add two or three monitors with a combined resolution of up to 3840 x 1024 to your workstation, gaming system or laptop, even if that system only supports a single display output. For example, connecting three 19" monitors would give your desktop an incredible 45" of total diagonal. The latest in Matrox's new series of Graphics eXpansion Modules (GXMs), TripleHead2Go delivers incredible productivity boosts to office work, Surround Design to workstation environments for professionals and an immersive Surround Gaming experience to enthusiasts with support for over 150 popular gaming titles.  TripleHead2Go is not a graphics card but an external box that harnesses your system's existing graphics solution (including SLI) for rendering of all 2D, 3D and video, and adds multi-monitor support. TripleHead2Go appears to your system as an ultra-widescreen 3840x1024* monitor and simply connects to your computer via a standard analog VGA monitor cable. Using Matrox patent-pending technology, TripleHead2Go then splits the 3840 x 1024 Microsoft Windows desktop into three separate 1280 x 1024 screens of information, and displays across three independent 1280 x 1024 monitors. There is no image distortion and no scaling to the original raw pixels generated from the existing graphics accelerator.
