Huhushop(TM) Straight needle APM 2.5 Flight Controller Board For Multicopter APM2.0 ARDUPILOT MEGA Case dkp Description:   - APM 2.5 is Upgarde version of APM2.0,and theres NO difference in performance at all between the two, the board is still the same in terms of functionally and it runs exactly the same code as APM 2.0. We just took the liberty of throwing in a few new universal connectors in there (so accessories can be cross compatible with the new PX4 and protect the user from connecting the cable in the wrong direction), some production improvements that will allows to manufacture it faster and finally we added some protection features to protect it from those reverse polarity/short circuit lovers.
