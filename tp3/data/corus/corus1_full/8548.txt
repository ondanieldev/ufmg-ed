Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e Chromebook 11.6" Tablet 2-in-1 Convertible PC Feel safe sharing your ThinkPad Yoga 11e Chromebook with friends, family and even the occasional guest. Each user has their own login, files, apps and settings, so you never have to worry about anything getting messed up by someone else. 100GB Google Drive Storage included at no charge for two years: Store and access your photos, music, videos, documents and more from anywhere with Google Drive. It's simple, and all your files are backed up automatically online, safely and securely. A key advantage of Chromebooks stateless system is that nothing is saved locally,  instead all your apps, preferences, documents, and data are saved on Googles servers in the cloud. In practice, this means if you are unlucky enough to lose your machine, have it stolen, or throw a cup of coffee over it, there is absolutely no risk to your information. Compare that to Windows or Macs, where unless you are diligent enough to back everything up on a weekly basis you are at risk of losing everything, and its easy to see why Chromebooks hold the advantage.
