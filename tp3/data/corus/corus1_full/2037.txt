Monoprice T Adapter Cat5e 1M/2F, 6 inch (101107) T-adapters for CAT5e (Ethernet) applications are great cost saving devices that help to reduce the number of lines needed to connect two distant points. They ARE NOT splitters in the traditional sense. You CAN NOT use it to split a single port on a modem computer switch router or hub. What they do allow you to do is connect 2 ports on a switch hub or router to 2 different computers using a single Ethernet cable to bridge the two points. It takes the initial two Ethernet connections from two PC's into the two female ports on the "T" adapter. The male Ethernet cable attached to the "T" adapter connects to a wall plate/inline coupler/network panel. Then from the wall plate/inline coupler/network panel to the "T" adapter's male Ethernet cable and branches off to two female ports with Ethernet cables connected to and from the Router/Hub/Switch.
