Cambridge Audio DacMagic Digital-to-Analog Converter with USB, Black With the advent of computer-based music systems, Cambridge Audio's DacMagic upsampling digital-to-analog converter is the most affordable and effective way to upgrade any PC, network music device, games console, or standard CD/DVD player to truly high-end sound quality. The DacMagic dramatically improves sound quality, putting digital music and gaming audio in a totally new light. Cambridge Audio has a passion for faithfully reproducing music as those in the recording studio intended, and with the DacMagic, the company has once again set a new benchmark for audiophile excellence at a more than affordable price. The DacMagic has a variety of simple connections including S/PDIF, Toslink, and USB inputs. That means it can be used to improve a wide range of devices with digital outputs, such as soundcards, portable media player docks, or networked music devices. Twin Wolfson DACs provide outstanding stereo imaging, while a choice of digital filters is available for individual preference and flexibility. The USB input connects direct to PC without drivers to act as very high quality DAC/soundcard, providing genuine hi-fi quality playback from desktop or media PC. Key to its abilities is Adaptive Time Filtering (ATF) upsampling technology developed in conjunction with Anagram Technologies of Switzerland. This technology converts 16-24 bit audio data to 24 bit / 192kHz dramatically improving musical reproduction. A 32 bit Digital Signal Processor (DSP) eradicates jitter which is especially effective with hard disk playback from PCs. The DacMagic provides a choice of filters that let you fine-tune the results. Linear phase, minimum phase and steep filter can all be selected to suit your listening preferences. Phase select to invert or reinvert input allows you to correct for possible recording problems.
