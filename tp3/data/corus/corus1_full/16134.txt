The JAY by Redbird The Jay is more than a simulatorits a flight experience device supporting training, proficiency, and just plain fun! It contains the monitor, computer and flight controls all in one unit that is easy to setup and fly right out of the box. The Jay boots up directly to a launch screen where you can select your airplane, airport and weather conditions. In addition to the free flight mode the Jay has a scenario mode where you can load a preset scenario and fly it. The Jay chassis is made entirely of metal and it utilizes many of the same components and software as larger Redbird simulators, including Lockheed Martins Prepar3D simulation software.
