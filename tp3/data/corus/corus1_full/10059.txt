Streacom ST-FLIRC-SE Universal Remote IR Receiver HTPC Components The FLIRC-SE (Streacom Edition) brings you all the amazing features of FLIRC, but in a package designed to fit inside Streacom cases and with the additional advantage of power on from S4/S5 power states*.  For those of you who dont know, FLIRC is the #1 solution for PC IR control and incredibly easy and flexible to use. FLIRC learns virtually any IR remote, not caring about different vendor protocols or codes. No need to look up the remote model, just walk through the super simple software setup, pairing individual remote buttons with keyboard/actions on the PC and youre done. This also allows you to fully customize which button are used for what function and more importantly means you can use your existing remote control instead of having to purchase a dedicated one.  The software runs on Windows, Linux and OSX, and since the GUI was designed with QT, its uniform across all platforms. All remote pairing information is stored on the FLIRC itself, meaning that even if you wipe your system, you wont need to repeat the pairing procedure.
