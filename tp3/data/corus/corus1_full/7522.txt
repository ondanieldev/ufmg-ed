1U Flat Cable Lacing Panel The Kendall Howard 1U Flat Cable Lacing Panel is a top choice for managing and routing cables to and from patch panels, switches or other networking devices. Designed with you in mind, this cable management panel was built to support and organize cables, providing easy access to connections without taking up much room in an already crowded area. Simply mount the panel above or below your networking device, secure cables to the numerous vertical and horizontal lacing slots with the help of the Hook and Loop Cable Ties, and see the difference the panel makes within your rack. Numerous Lacing Slots - Lacing slots nearly cover the entire length of the panel allowing convenient routing to either side of the rack. No Mess Maintenance - Cables will now be organized in such a fashion that little effort is needed to locate the right cable. Maintenance times will decrease as a result of this organization. Strain Reliever - Relieves cable weight from network equipment, and also helps to avoid connection ports from being damaged or disconnected. Rounded Corners - All corners are rounded to avoid snagging or damaging cables, hands, and/or other devices. Universal Mounting - This lacing panel features standard 19" EIA compliant mounting holes that are compatible with any standard rack hardware. (Hardware not included.)
