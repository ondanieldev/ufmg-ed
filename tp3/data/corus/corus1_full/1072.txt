USAGE NOTES:   * Low Conductivity : As with all Low-Conductive fluids, PC PURE can become more conductive if it comes in contact with excessive dust or other fluids that may be conductive. The Low-Conductive aspect of PC PURE is used as a safety measure only. It is always a good idea to keep your system clean and free of dust, especially in a water cooled system. PrimoChill is not responsible for any hardware damage. Use at your own risk.    **DO NOT MIX: PC PURE includes an Anti-Microbial agent, we do not recommend mixing any other anti-algae or anti-microbial agents with the PC PURE fluid, this includes Liquid Utopia. Adding additional agents will cause a chemical reaction with the agent currently in the fluid. It is not dangerous, it will just cause the fluid not to operate at maximum levels and may cause unwanted build up.  Packaging Note: Amazon requires all bottles to be taped for shipping.
