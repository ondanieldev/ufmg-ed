IPEVO FR-33.2 Skype USB Handset with LCD- White With the Skype USB Handset with LCD FR-33.2 by IPEVO, the power of low-cost or free Skype Internet calling is put into the palm of your hand. Ideal for those who wish to enjoy the advantages of Skype with the familiarity, feel, and comfort of a handset phone, the FR-33.2 allows you to accomplish many Skype functions with a combination menu navigation and number pad interface - no mouse or keyboard required!  The FR-33.2 is a USB device, and is powered via USB connection. After installation of the provided drivers and the linking of your computer's Skype application with the FR-33.2, your Skype contacts will appear via the phone's LCD screen. Find the person you're looking for in a variety of intuitive ways: by navigating through your contacts via the handset's unique Joggle (Jog/Toggle) key; by bringing up contact lists with the List button; with the call history; or by typing in first letters of contact names via the traditional number pad. From there, you can initiate calls (including calls via SkypeOut, an optional program that allows you to call non-Skype phone numbers), talk for as long as you want with the familiar weight and feel of the handset, and end your call, all with the handset. No more clicking through menus to make a basic phone call.  The FR-33.2 comes complete with a variety of smart features. Along with the handy phone features you've come to expect - volume control, mute, accept call, end call - the FR-33.2 features included freeREC software, which allows one-touch recording for important phone conversations, voice memos, or those spur-of-the-moment ideas. FreeREC will store audio files directly onto your computer's hard drive for easy access and organization.
