Sonnet Technologies RackMac Mini Super Drive Bracket (RACK-MIN-SDBK) Believe it or not, some people still use DVDs and CDs, but the latest Mac mini and Mac mini Server don't have a disc slot. Apple does offer a standalone optical disc drive, better known as the Apple MacBook Air SuperDrive, which connects to a USB port and allows you to play and burn CDs and DVDs. Sonnet has created an easy to install bracket for this optical drive that enables you to securely install the device in the left bay of the RackMac mini with no fuss; like the SuperDrive, it's the essence of simplicity.
