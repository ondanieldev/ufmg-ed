Mobile Edge quality, blended with Razer's cutting-edge gaming styling, create great-looking, great-performing cases. Designed to take a beating, the Razer Backpack is made from the same materials used for military flak jackets - thick, tightly woven robust ballistic nylon. Its water-resistant, scratch and tear-proof exterior effortlessly protects your gear as you take on the perils of everyday life. It's designed to carry laptops up to 17.3, and comes complete with an additional MicroFiber lined pouch for a Tablet. The frameless design with heavily padded shoulder straps and moisture wicking back panel ensures comfort and ease regardless of what you carry. The adjustable chest strap evenly distributes the weight of a heavier load over your back, so you experience less fatigue. The rugged design also incorporates a rain poncho large enough to cover the entire bag, protecting it from the elements. Covered by a lifetime warranty, this laptop backpack is built to last!
