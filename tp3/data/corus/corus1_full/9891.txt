Assembled Pi Cobbler Plus - Breakout Cable for Raspberry Pi B+ The Raspberry Pi B+ has landed on the Maker World like a 40-GPIO pinned, quad-USB ported, credit card sized bomb of DIY joy. And while you can use most of our great Model B accessories by hooking up our downgrade cable, its probably a good time to upgrade your set up and accessorize using all of the Model B+'s 40 pins.  That's why we now carry the Adafruit Assembled Pi Cobbler Plus - Breakout and Cable for Raspberry Pi B+. It's an add on prototyping Pi Cobbler from Adafruit specifically designed for the B+ that you can break out all those tasty power, GPIO, I2C and SPI pins from the 40-pin header onto a solderless breadboard. This will make "cobbling together" prototypes with the Pi super easy.  Designed for use with Raspberry Pi Model B+ only! No soldering required!  This Cobbler is in a compact shape, which is the least bulky way to wire up. The cable plugs between the Pi B+ computer and the Cobbler breakout. The Cobbler can plug into any solderless breadboard (or even a prototyping board like the PermaProto). The Cobbler PCB has all the pins labeled nicely so you can go forth and build circuits without keeping a pin-out printout at your desk. We think this will make it more fun to expand the Pi and build custom circuitry with it.  Please note, this product only contains an assembled Cobbler Plus and 40-pin ribbon cable (in slimming Adafruit Black). Raspberry Pi B+, solderless breadboard, breadboarding wires, cables, components, power supply, etc are not included! We do stock many of those items in the shop, so check those out as well!
