BBC micro:bit micro-controller with motion detection, compass, LED display and Bluetooth The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized codeable computer with motion detection, a built-in compass, LED display, and Bluetooth technology built in. It measures 4cm by 5cm, is available in a range of colours, and designed to be fun and easy to use. It can be coded with something simple in seconds  like lighting up its LEDs or displaying a pattern  with no prior knowledge of computing. It also connects to other devices, sensors, kits and objects, and is a companion to Arduino, Galileo, Kano, littleBits and Raspberry Pi, acting as a spring board to more complex learning. Each element is completely programmable via easy-to-use software on a dedicated website that can be accessed from a PC, tablet or mobile.
