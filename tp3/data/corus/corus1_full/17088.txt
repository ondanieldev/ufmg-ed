THE MACBETH COLLECTION MB-L1501-LZA 15.6" Badge Notebook Sleeve (Liza) The Macbeth Badge Sleeve is a universal notebook sleeve that fits computers up to 15.6-in and protects your computer from damage as you transport it where needed. A retractable top handle makes it easy and convenient to carry your notebook computer wherever you need to go, and a faux-fur interior prevents scratching while in transport. A wide opening with a secure zipper makes it easy to put your computer in and take it out of the sleeve, and a colorful pattern makes this sleeve as stylish as it is functional.
