GERBER 31-001759 / Gerber Mini Outrigger Fine Edge Knife Being small has its advantages. When others look to brawn to solve a problem, the small tend to use their heads. This is where the Gerber Outrigger Mini comes in. Tiny in stature, but big on ability, this little knife has the DNA of its larger siblings, in a package suited to smaller hands or to those who like a tool that's virtually weightless. A reliable daily carry knife needs to do more than cut well. It has to be pickup truck tough but not monster truck heavy, open fast and easily, and sit comfortably in your hand. The blade should make quick work of slicing anything from stubborn knots to lunch, but not be so long or so short that it's awkward or out of balance. Though it may be small, the Outrigger Mini meets all of these qualifications.
