Disney - En Route pour la Jungle - Les Coccibelles et Hippobus (Import Royaume Uni) The Jungle Junction animated series follows a group of animals on wheels as they explore the magical jungle where the live. Have fun transporting the Beetle Bugs round with the Hippobus Play Set, complete with sounds. Let the Beetle Bugs out through the door or down the slide. During transportation make sure they are safely sitting in their colour coded seats. When it's time for them to go to school, drive the five Beetle Bugs into the Hippobus and get them to school in Jungle Junction's smoothest ride. On the way, you can press Hippobus's ear to hear her make sounds. When Hippobus gets to school, open her door and watch the Beetle Bugs roll down the ramp. Includes Hippobus, 5 Beetle Bugs and 2 road signs. The Hippobus needs three AG13 cell batteries to work, which are included. For ages 3+
