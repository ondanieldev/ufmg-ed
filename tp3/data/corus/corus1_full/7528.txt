PageFlip Firefly Bluetooth/USB Page Turner Pedal The PageFlip Firefly is a wireless Bluetooth/USB pedal designed to meet the needs of musicians who struggle with the challenge and inconvenience of page turning. By simply tapping the dual pedal of the PageFlip Firefly, digital content (e.g., PDF files) can now be flipped or scrolled in either the forward or reverse directions for convenient hands-free reading on iPad/Android tablets and Windows/Mac/Linux computers. The PageFlip Firefly emulates a standard keyboard and works with any software that uses keyboard strokes to navigate through digital files. For added versatility, the user may select among five modes for the dual pedals: PageUp/PageDown, Left/Right arrow, Up/Down arrow, Left/Right mouse click, and Space/Enter. Changing modes is as simple as pressing a button. The PageFlip Firefly works with iPads under select keyboard-compatible apps such as forScore, unrealBook, Deepdish GigBook, NextPage, OnSong, MusicReader, and Planning Center Online. Compatible Android apps include MobileSheets, MusicNotes, Moon+ Reader, and EBookDroid. The pedal, which is powered by two AA batteries, includes a USB cable. The Firefly builds upon the success of the PageFlip Cicada by adding the following key features: (1) illuminated pedals for use in dim venues, (2) five programmable pedal modes, (3) 30-minute timeout period before pedal enters sleep mode, (4) operates in wireless (Bluetooth) or wired (USB) mode, and (5) hefty/rugged construction with silent pedal mechanism. Once you try the Bluetooth/USB pedal you will be amazed by the convenience of hands-free page turning.
