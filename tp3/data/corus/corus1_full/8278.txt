Noctua NA-SRC10, 3 Pin Low-Noise Adaptor Cables for PC fans (Black) The NA-SRC10 is a fan accessory set consisting of three fully sleeved NA-RC10 Low Noise Adaptors (LNA) for Noctua 3-pin fans. Connected between the fan and the power source, the adaptors reduce the running speed and noise emission of the fans. The NA-SRC10 is ideal for slowing down Noctuas redux edition fans. Not compatible with Noctua's IndustrialPPC series. Never use one Low-Noise Adaptor to slow down multiple fans. Always use one adaptor per fan. The NA-RC10 adaptor is designed for use with Noctua 3-pin fans (except industrialPPC series). While it may work with many other fans, use with third party fans is not officially supported by Noctua, is at the customers own risk and will void the warranty. The NA-RC10 adaptor is strictly not to be used with fans that draw more than 2.5W of power.
