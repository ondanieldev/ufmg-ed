From the inside-out, the tools you need to win and the customization options that'll make you stand out from the crowd are all in your hands. Our performance tuned sensor offers pixel perfect movements and adjusts CPI based on your needs. Instantly switch from lightning-fast twitch movements to slowing things down and aiming with extra precision. Whether you need to look around the map quickly or going for that crucial play, youll be ready for any situation that arises. The ergonomic shape has been designed for right-handed palm grip players. A slightly larger than average contoured body and a thumb and pinky rest allows your hand and arm muscles to relax. Features 9 buttons with each click feels just right - not too heavy and not so light that you accidently click them and guaranteed to each last 20 million clicks. The mouse body is covered in a matte UV coating. This coating is highly durable and won't peel, wear off, or tarnish. Mouse buttons include rubberized grip texture to keep you in total control. Want advanced macro programming? Our user friendly software makes creating even the complex macros quick and easy. You can customize every single button with a macro. Save all your macros into 5 profiles. Example: Make a high DPI profile for when you use close range weapons and instantly switch to a low sensitivity sniper profile mode when you've cleared the area.
