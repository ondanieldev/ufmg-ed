Scalextric 1:32 Digital Triple Cup Slot Car Race Track Set x3 Porsche 997 C1223T Welcome to the exciting world of Scalextric Digital. This set allows you to race up to four cars at the same time (three cars are provided), performing amazing, realistic overtaking and braking manoeuvres. You can switch lanes at the touch of a button to overtake or block your opponent. This set includes everything you need to get started with Scalextric Digital--it features a long oval circuit and comes supplied with three Digital Chip installed cars. Additional digital cars are available or you can easily convert most standard cars to run on digital layouts. Also included is the exciting Digital Pit Lane game. Select up to three pit stops per race - the pits will open randomly for five seconds at a time. Enter the pits when open to extinguish one Pit Stop light, but take care, if you enter the pits when they are closed you will receive an extra Pit Stop penalty! Extinguish all pit stop lights first to win the game. The Digital Pit Lane Game is powered from the track. No batteries are required. The three super resistant Porsche 997 cars feature detailed livery designs. The cars feature easy change pick-ups and the Magnatraction system to help them stay on the circuit. Four cars can be raced simultaneously using the powerbase provided in the set or upgrade to the Advanced Six Car Digital Powerbase (C7042) for six car races plus a host of additional features. Digital layouts are fully compatible with standard Scalextric track pieces.
