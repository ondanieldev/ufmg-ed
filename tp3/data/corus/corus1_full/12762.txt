TNP Cat7 Ethernet Network Cable (1.5 FT) - High Performance 10 Gigabit Ethernet 600MHz with Professional Gold Plated Snagless RJ45 Connector Premium Shielded Twisted Pair S/STP Patch Plug Wire Cord The Category 7 cable standard has been created to allow 10 Gigabit Ethernet over 100m of copper cabling (also, 10 Gbit/s Ethernet now is typically run on Cat6). The cable contains four twisted copper wire pairs, just like the earlier standards. Category 7 cable is rated for transmission frequencies of up to 600 MHz.Class F channel and Category 7 cable are backward compatible with Class D / Category cat5e and Class E/Category cat6. Class F features even stricter specifications for cross-talk and system noise than Class E. To achieve this, shielding has been added for individual wire pairs and the cable as a whole. Besides the shield, the twisting of the pairs and number of turns per unit length increases RF shielding and protects from crosstalk.Specification:Double Shielded Twisted Pair S/STP Cable - Each Twisted Pair is shielded with Aluminum Mylar Foil - Plus 85% Tinned Copper Braid ShieldConnectors Type - RJ45 Male to RJ45 MaleCompliant with ANSI/TIA/EIA 568-B, 2-1, Up to 10 Gbps Speed and Meet all Proposed CAT-7 RequirementsShielded RJ45 Connector to Protect Against EMI/RFI InterferencePackage Content:1x 1.5 Feet CAT-7 RJ45 LAN Ethernet Network Cable Black
