Game of Thrones Westeros Mousepad The Game of Thrones Westeros Mousepad picks up an illustration from the Game of Thrones. Ruling the great continent of Westeros, as seen on the mouse pad, is an honor the great houses are fighting to obtain. Comprised of the Seven Kingdoms and varying dramatically in temperature from one region to the next, Westeros is the homeland of all the great houses, as the mousepad clearly indicates. The Game of Thrones Westeros Mousepad highlights the layout of the land, including the famous Winterfell, home to the King's Hand, Eddard Stark, and Kings Landing, home to King Robert Baratheon.
