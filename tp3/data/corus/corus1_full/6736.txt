Griffin Black/Brown Back Bay Multi-Positional Folio for iPad Air - Carry your iPad in this sophisticated folio. The case flips open for quick access to your touchscreen, and closes like a book for privacy and protection. This folio has the professional look and feel you'd expect from a much more expensive case. Inside, a smooth inner lining protects your iPad from scratches. Cutouts strategically placed around the edges and back provide easy access to all ports, controls connectors, and camera lens.
