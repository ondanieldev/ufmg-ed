Arkon Clamp Mounting Pedestal with 12 inch Gooseneck This is not a complete mount solution and includes only the Heavy-Duty Aluminum Desk or Cart Mounting Pedestal with 12 Flexible Gooseneck and C-Clamp Base. (Holders sold separately.) Arkons GN086-12-SBH heavy-duty desk, cart, or table mounting pedestal replaces or upgrades an existing pedestal and is compatible with Arkons Dual-T universal phone and tablet holders (sold separately), including the Slim-Grip Ultra Universal Smartphone and Midsize Tablet Holder (SM060-2), Slim-Grip Universal Tablet Holder (TAB001), Universal Tablet Push Button Holder (TAB003), and Mega Grip Universal Smartphone Holder (SM040-2). The heavy-duty mounting pedestal is made of strong yet flexible aluminum, and is ideal for an office or workspace where easy access to a phone or tablet mount is needed, but where surface space is at a premium. Install the C-clamp base on a desk, cart, worktable, bench, lectern, or other table-like surfaces. The C-clamp maintains a firm grip and opens as wide as 2.5 inches and closes as tight as .5 inches. Bend the 12 gooseneck and rotate the swivel ball adapter head for 360-degree rotation for exact positioning of the device.
