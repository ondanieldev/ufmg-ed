Thin Mini-ITX Computer Case for 1U Rackmount or Shelf mount- Model # INT-TX482-1U Build the ultimate media PC with this specialized compact system kit. Just add a notebook drive, CPU, memory, and your own breed of operating system and software. The system is designed to work with any thin mini-itx motherboard with a half height back plate. It is the only 1U, thin media PC mini-itx configuration available anywhere.  This handcrafted aircraft aluminum unit measures a mere 8.5(l) x 8.75(w) x 1.75(h). It can be combined with an additional unit in a 1U dual rack-mount configuration using our specialized Dual Unit Rackmount Faceplate (sold separately). In addition, it can be combined with our optical/notebook drive unit which looks great on any shelf. It can also be mounted vertically using the VESA mount holes in the bottom of the case.  This kit requires a thin mini-itx motherboard and CPU which is not included. Depending on the motherboard chosen, you may need to purchase a CPU Cooler. We do not provide the CPU cooler. If needed, we recommend the Dynatron K2 or K199 coolers with a side vent for best cooling. The Notebook Drive bracket provided in the kit mounts as pictured and may not fit the same for all motherboards as the components on some motherboards require a modification of the single support leg of the bracket. This is not a difficult adjustment. Some of the Thin mini-ITX motherboards that can be mounted in our case include the following: Asus H81T/CSM, Q87T/CSM; ECS H87H3-TI, Q77H2-TI: Gigabyte GA-H77TN, GA-H87TN; as well as many others.
