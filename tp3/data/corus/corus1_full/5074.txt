Cherry MX Rubber O-Ring Switch Dampeners Red 40A-L - 0.2mm Reduction (125pcs) "Bottoming out" is a term used to describe when a keystroke is pressed all the way down where the stem of the switch hits the inside of the switch casing. This causes a "clack" from the collision on mechanical keyboards. Switch sound dampeners are soft rubber O-rings that can be installed onto every single keycap stem to cushion the landing of the switch by stopping the keystroke just short of the point of bottoming out. This also very slightly reduces the max travel distance of the switch. (0.2-0.4mm of 4mm total travel distance. Varies by O-ring type.) This modification is popular among mechanical keyboard owners from around the world. Since most people will bottom out at least a fraction of their keystrokes, the switch sound dampeners will cut away extra noise giving your mechanical keyboard a consistent sound output while typing. The added shock absorption can also help with finger fatigue during long typing sessions. Made of industrial grade EPDM rubber which has much better resistance to cracking and tearing than nitrile or silicon rubber. Fits firmly onto the stem of your Cherry MX keycap. Installation will require removal of your keycaps. Install O-ring on the stem of the keycap. Install the key and press down firmly to fully seat the O-ring. The O-rings are designed for our keycaps and keycaps from many other popular brands. Some keycaps, such as the ones found on Cherry Corp keyboards have different stem lengths and will not work properly with our O-rings.
