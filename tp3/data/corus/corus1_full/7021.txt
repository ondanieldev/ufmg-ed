Taipan spacesuit 15, gray The Taipan spacesuit is not your average MacBook sleeve. Its unique design makes it stand out from the crowd and adds stability while not adding weight. Premium neoprene in a honeycomb structure makes the Taipan spacesuit the most elegant defense against scratches and excessive wear. A super-soft plush interior protects your MacBook from scratches and will make you wish we made this sleeve in a bigger size so you could crawl into one. No bees were harmed for the sleeve's super-cool honeycomb pattern. While the sleeve's monochromatic design includes two removable black leather zipper pullers, three additional colored pullers allow a splash of color to be added.
