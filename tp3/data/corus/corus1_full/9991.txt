APG Men's Brown Canvas Leather Single Shoulder Cross Body Bag Military Messenger School Travel Hiking Satchel IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO BUYERS: The size of the shoulder bag is about 10.2 x 8.26 x 3.5 inch. It is not as large as a backbag, which you can even put your laptop in, maybe 14" or more. Someone may have visual illusion on the pictures, which indeed looks bigger, coz we need show the details to you with "bigger-look" pictures. I'd like to give you some suggestions here: It is great on the go, right size for day trips, not a very big bag but sufficient enough to Carry your every day gadgetry. You can put cell phone, keys, pens, sunglasses, cell phone , jewelry, lipstick, watch, ipad ( 9.7inch or smaller ), or something small but valuable in the shoulder bag, not suitable for laptops. If you still has no concept of the size, needn't be hesitated, becuase you got 30 days to return it and get full payment back.  Product Experience This is a great military style messenger Bag! when you lift at the front flap you have an outer pocket with no zipper. I use this for my phone. next is the zip pocket. I put my tablet in there and it fits just fine. Next is the largest pocket.. You could fit a large tablet in there with no problem. It has a drawstring to keep it closed. Also inside the large pocket is a zipper compartment. Certainly large enough for your wallet, a medium back up power supply. The flap has little magnets that do a surprisingly good job holding it closed. Then 2 mesh side pockets and one little pouch by the strap. I put my key fob for my car there. Fits perfect.  Package Included: 1 X Retro Canvas Messenger Bag  Note: Due to different camera or light environment,it may result in little color difference,please kindly understand.
