RasPiO Breakout RasPiO Breakout reduces the chances of wiring errors because you can clearly see which pin corresponds to which port. You dont need to consult a pinout chart or count X pins up from the bottom-right pin. This means your circuits are more likely to work first time and youre less likely to damage your Pi or attached electronics. If you work on lots of projects at once, you can soon find you run out of Raspberry Pis. You can either buy more Pis, or undo the wiring from one of your projects. With RasPiO Breakout, the wiring goes to the RasPiO Breakout board and not the Pi. You can disconnect the Pi, leaving all the wiring intact, and repurpose your Pi at a moments notice without messing up your project.
