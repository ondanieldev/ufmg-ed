AntMiner S3 441Gh/s @ 0.77W/Gh 28nm SHA-256 ASIC Miner S3+ Specifications:  Hash Rate: 453 GH/s10% Power Consumption: 355 Watt at the wall  Power Efficiency: 0.78J/GH on wall Power Supply: 12V DC Size:  331 mm x 137 mm x 160 mm  Fans: Two 14038 fans mounted on both front and back ends Operating Temperature: 0 C to 35 C Complied with: FCC / CE Network Connection: Ethernet  Power consumption: This figure depends on the PSU efficiency, ambient temperature and the accuracy of the power meters.  Features:  Stand alone: The S3+ mines stand alone, needs no proxy server or a separate computer. (no need of Rpi or Beagle Bone Black or Cubie Board)  Quiet: The customized heat sinks mounted to the hash boards, one box over S3+ to control the air flow, two fans mounted on both front and back ends that mean fans are able to work at lower speed to dissipate all heat easily. This design let S3+ run at much lower noise level.  Stable: Running 24 hours a day with minimal downtime.  Accurate: Hardware Error rate from the sample unit is as low as 0.01%, hundreds times better than some competing products.  Efficient: High energy efficiency to save your investment on PSU and electricity bills.  Notes:  1)   Power consumption: This figure depends on the PSU efficiency, ambient temperature and the accuracy of the power meters.  2)   PSU: You have to prepare your own the ATX PSU. The S3+ ships without a Power Supply Unit. There are 4 PCI-e connectors for +12V DC input, but it only needs to connect two of them. Dont parallel connected different DC input from different PSU into the same Hashing board.  OVER CLOCKING, MODIFYING CONFIGURATION INACCESSIBLE FROM THE WEB CONTROL PANEL VOIDS WARRANTY
