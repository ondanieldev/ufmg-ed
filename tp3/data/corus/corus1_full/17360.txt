WeatherPlus - All in One Weather Station Controller WeatherPlus is an all in one weather station controller and is the board that is used in the OurWeather Complete Weather Kit by SwitchDoc Labs. WeatherPlus contains an ESP8266 processor (includes WiFi) and does not require an external computer to run. If you want to program the WeatherPlus board, we supply all of the source code to allow you to do that. The software for the board is written using the Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 libraries added. Here is our tutorial on how to install the Arduino IDE for the ESP8266. Two other accessories from SwitchDoc Labs you might want are: - Inexpensive FTDI Cable (fits headers on WeatherPlus) - Grove OLED Display (fits Grove connection on Weather Plus) A DS3231 Real Time Clock Board is included.
