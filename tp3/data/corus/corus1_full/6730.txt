The case flips open for quick access to your touchscreen, and closes like a book for privacy and protection. Slim Folio's microsuede inner lining protects your iPad from scratches. Custom cutouts give easy access to camera lens, controls and connectors. This folio protects your iPad while you're carrying it, but it doesn't stop working when you get where you're going. Flip the cover around and lock it in back to turn the folio into a 2-position workstand. Slim Folio holds your iPad upright in landscape position for reading and viewing pictures and video. For drawing, tapping and typing, turn it over and lay it down in a comfortably inclined position.
