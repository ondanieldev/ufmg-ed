Earth People Technology Altera MAX V CPLD Development System - MegaProLogic Designed, Manufactured and Distributed in the USA.  The EPT USB-CPLD development system provides a  flexible learning platform by combining a powerful  Complex Programmable Logic Device with High Speed  USB. It is designed to provide an innovative method of  developing and debugging programmable logic code. It provides a high speed data transfer mechanism between any  microcontroller (or any digital device) and a host PC. The  EPT USB-CPLD development system provides a convenient,  user-friendly work flow by connecting seamlessly with Alteras  Quartus II software. The user will develop the code in the  Quartus environment on a Windows Personal Computer. The  programmable logic code is then loaded into the CPLD using  only the Quartus Programmer software and a standard USB  cable. The programmer hardware is built in to the EPT-5M570-AP.  The ActiveHost API provides a highly configurable communications  interface between CPLD and host PC. It connects transparently  to the Active Transfer Library running inthe CPLD code.
