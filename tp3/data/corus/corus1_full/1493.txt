IPEVO ST-4RT.1 Universal VoIP Handset (Pack of 2) Fill the void in your online communication experience The image of having a conversation over the Internet wearing a microphone headset plugged into a computer leaves an unsatisfying feeling about Internet phone calls. To give Internet phone calls a fresh identity, we need to move away from that inseparable link between Internet and computers, and think about the type of communication experience that we enjoy with normal telephone calls. For a sensible and comfortable way to talk online, pick up a ST-4RT.1 today.  Works with any Instant Messaging software ST-4RT.1 allows you to use the voice chat function of your Instant Messaging software, but substitutes a slim and comfortable handset better suited to normal phone conversations compared to the awkward microphone headset. With your Instant Messaging software running, simply plug the audio input and output connection on ST-4RT.1 into your computer and the installation is complete. Activate the voice chat option on your Instant Messaging software to start making voice calls to people on your contact list.  Light and compact design leaves no loose ends Small but handy design features make ST-4RT.1 a device that leaves no messy trails. Cables are bound together and conveniently split at the end to accommodate different spacing between the headphone and microphone connections. Audio jacks lock together and fit inside a storage space created by the cables wrapped around the mouthpiece opening, for a neat and practical cable management.
