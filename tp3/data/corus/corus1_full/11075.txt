CableDeconn 1M Mini-SAS SFF8087 To 4x Straight Reverse SATA Fanout Cable Blue Specification:   Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a high-speed data storage interface designed for high-throughput and fast data access.   Intended primarily for data storage centers the SAS interface is backwards compatible with SATA.   This allows the user to mix more expensive lower-capacity SAS drives for applications that require faster data access and higher reliability with lower-cost higher-capacity SATA drives for applications with lower access speed requirements.   This 0.5meter long cable uses 30 AWG wires and is intended for internal use.  It has a single 36-pin SFF-8087 male Mini-SAS plug (with locking latch) on one end and has four 7-pin SATA female plugs (with locking latches) on the other allowing you to connect four SATA drives to an SAS controller.   This is a Reverse Breakout cable meaning that it is intended to connect to a SAS backplane to 4 SATA host controllers.    Package Includes:  1 x Deconn 1M Mini-SAS SFF8087 To 4x Straight Reverse SATA Fanout Cable Blue
