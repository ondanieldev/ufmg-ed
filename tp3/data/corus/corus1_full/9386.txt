Griffin Plume Multi Positional TurnFolio for Large to Extra Large-sized Tablets - Rotating case and a custom fit for your 9-10" tablet Inside the folio covers, a rotating platform grips your tablet with special elastic clips at the corners, leaving the entire surface of your touchscreen accessible to your fingers. The platform rotates a full 360 degrees, for viewing in landscape or portrait or any angle in between. The cover folds into a stand, adjustable to any comfortable viewing angle. And the inside is fully lined with soft, nonscratch Microliner fabric. When you want to work one-handed, the rotating platform snaps out of the covers to stay with your tablet. Just snap it back in to use as a viewing stand or fold it up and go.
