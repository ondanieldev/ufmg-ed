SparkFun ToF Range Finder Sensor - VL6180 This is the SparkFun Time-of-Flight Range Finder, a sensor board for the VL6180 distance sensor. Unlike most distance sensors that rely on reflected light intensity or reflected angles to determine range, the VL6180 uses a precise clock to measure the time it takes light to bounce back from a surface. This affords the ToF Range Finder and VL6180 a great benefit over other methods because it can be much more accurate and more immune to noise. Does this technology sound familiar? Well it should, its the same means cellphones use to detect when the caller is holding their phone to their ear.
