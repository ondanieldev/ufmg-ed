Monoprice 10957 USB 2.0 Retractable Cable - A Male to Micro B Male Angled - 2.5 ft. You'll never deal with a tangled USB cable again when you use this USB 2.0 Retractable Cable from Monoprice! This flat; 2.5-foot long USB 2.0 cable is wound around a central spring-loaded spool. Pulling on the two connector ends unwinds the cable; while the internal ratchet action keeps the cable extracted to the length you want. Pull the cable ends to their limit and the cable will easily wind itself back around the spool; thereby preventing tangles. This USB 2.0 cable features a USB A male connector on one end and a 90-degree angled USB micro B male connector on the other end. The spool assembly measures about 1.1" in diameter and is about 0.6" thick.
