Green onions supply AG2 Anti-Glare Screen Protector, 14" Wide (RT-SPM14X02) This is an AG2 anti-glare screen protector for Alienware m14x. It protects and transforms your screen, providing a medium matte finish that gives you glare reduction with exceptional clarity. The AG2 anti-glare coating is designed to provide an excellent medium between anti-glare and glossy. AG2 itself stands for anti-grain anti-glare; many matte and anti-glare finishes create heavy distortion and obvious visual "grains", but the AG2 coating manages to pack 60% of a standard anti-glare coating's glare-reducing abilities while being almost as clear as a glossy screen. The protector uses silicone glue for a secure, residue free attachment, and it can be easily removed and reapplied if necessary. Also included in the package are a high-quality micro-fiber Cloth for cleaning, and a dust isolation sheet to help aid installation. The screen protector is very slim, so fits within a closed m14x, and has cut-out holes for the Webcam and Microphone.
