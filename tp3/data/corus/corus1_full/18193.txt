Zoom 8x4 Cable Modem, 343 Mbps DOCSIS 3.0, Model 5345R (Certified Refurbished) The Zoom Model 5345 is a 343 Mbps cable modem certified for money-saving own-your-own cable modem programs by Comcast XFINITY, Time Warner Cable, and other leading cable service providers. Owning a certified own-your-own modem eliminates modem rental charges that are typically $8 to $10 dollars per month. The Model 5345 Gigabit (10-100-1000 Mbps) Ethernet port connects to your Windows or Macintosh computer, router, wireless access point, HomePlug adapter, or other Ethernet-enabled device. When used with a router, the high speed Internet service can be shared with multiple devices. The number of channels supported by a cable modem is the primary indicator of a modems top speed. This modem is 8x4, which supports eight channels for downloads, and four channels for uploads. Eight channels for data downloads make this modem up to twice as fast as competing modems that support only four channels. Because this 8x4 modem uses the cable network more efficiently, average download speeds can be faster, even for service speeds below the modems top speed of 343 Mbps. The 5345 is certified by CableLabs to support the latest DOCSIS 3.0 standard plus DOCSIS 2.0 and 1.1 for use with older cable systems. IPv6 and IPv4 are supported for powerful, flexible network addressing. With its easy installation, high speed, and extensively tested compatibility, the Model 5345 is the perfect choice for almost any cable modem user. The Model 5345 has been tested and certified by CableLabs to work with nearly all U.S. cable services. The Zoom 5345 is covered by a two year warranty and quality technical support by Zoom Telephonics, a Boston based company founded in 1977. This Certified Refurbished product is manufacturer refurbished, shows limited or no wear and includes all original accessories.
