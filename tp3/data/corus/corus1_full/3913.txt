Ayrstone AyrMesh Cab Hub The AyrMesh Cab Hub mounts in the cab of your tractor, sprayer, combine, or truck to connect the devices in the cab to your network. This allows you to use your smartphone, tablet, or laptop in the fields, as well as collect data from your WiFi-enabled cab computers. The custom-built power cable provides power to the hub, and the magnetic-mount antenna provides a durable outdoor antenna to maximize the Hubs range. The Cab Hub will connect to a Hub up to 2.5 miles away.
